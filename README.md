Front-end project made with the help of Trybe school. In this project I made a Web App with Vite that you can add products to your cart.

Important infos:
1. do a npm install to install the development dependencies to run the project on your computer.
2. it was not made with docker. That means it doesn't a container to run on most computers arround.
